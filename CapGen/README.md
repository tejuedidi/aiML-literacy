## How It Works
The app uses a combination of computer vision and language models:

1. BLIP is used to generate a natural-language description of the uploaded image.

2. CLIP compares the image to a set of predefined "vibes" and selects the closest match.

3. GPT-4o-mini generates three creative and hashtag-friendly captions based on the generated description, optional user description, and generated vibe.

4. Optionally, users can refine captions to their liking by communicating with genAI chat interface, which will regenerate captions to match the user's requirements.
